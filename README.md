## SimplePowerToys app

I built this for my own use, because some stuff is missing from [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) like window switcher and move mouse to other monitors.

### Features

- Window switcher: I built this because I have like 50 windows at a time, alt-tabbing is not fun.
- Move mouse to other monitor: I don't want to reach mouse for my multi monitor setup.
- Prevent sleep

### Feature request

I don't accept feature requests, feel free to fork if you want. this is all I need. But please report bugs.
